# React Demo

To run the demo you have to have the [backend](https://github.com/codayblue/react-demo-api) running on your local machine on port 8080 after that is running you can start the front end.

The front end requires node to run. So install node js and have access to npm. Once that is setup you can run the front end with the following commands after you have pulled the project down via git clone and are in that directory.

```
$> npm install
$> npm start
```

After you run the start command the browser should automatically open but if it doesn's go to localhost:3000 in your browser.
